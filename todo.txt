CollectionList/KitCollection - consider extending ObservableArray instead?

Check usages of getFirstTargetBox for handling undefined instead of null as a negative result

Memory:
  Atoms are storing too much info in their instances from their Element. It's convenient, but probably killing us.

Performance:
  ES5 getter/setter removal from inner-loop code

Specify sim title string for Sim

Common code for:
  HashMap
  Set

Preloader
Support portrait and landscape?
Full serialization?
Zoom/pan handler prototype
Recycling bin for molecules/atoms?
Handling hard-to-touch things:
  Scissors? - single-finger would interact with panning if zoomed in, might be acceptable
  3D button / break apart button - not sure
